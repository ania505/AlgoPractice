## Part 1
Use the first 5-10 minutes for introductions and high level "softer" questions. Things like: 
* "What's one thing about frontend work that you are passionate about and why?"
    <!-- I like making the user experience smooth. There is nothing more annoying than when a site cannot get simple
    functionality down and this is part of what fuels my passion to create sites that are enjoyable for the clients to use.
    As for the other part of my passion, I enjoy seeing the outcome of my work being reflected visually in the app I'm working on.  -->
* "What are you looking for in your next job, whether at Rally or otherwise?"
    <!-- I'm looking for a position where I can learn as I do and learn from the team of brilliant engineers I'm on -->
* "If you could change one thing about your current job's tech stack, what would it be and why?"
    <!-- Maybe change TypeScript to JS? IDKKKKK
    TS is like a more careful version of JS so I'm glad we are using that but I am more familiar with JS. TBH wouldn't change anything. -->

## Part 2
Use the bulk of the tech screen for one or more exercises that, in total, should cover CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

Try to include at least some basic questions about accessibility and testing as well, even if just things like 
* "What, EADN if anything, do you do to make sure your code meets accessibility standards?" and 
    <!-- EDAN? accessibility standards? -->
* "How do you unit test your code"? 
    <!-- PROBS NOT THE GOOD ANSWER: I write up my components so I have most of the variables ready to use in tests, then I write the tests that
    make sure my app is passing the right information through it. -->
If the candidate has experience in a framework you feel comfortable asking about, it's okay to ask a question in that framework (e.g., building a React component). However, don't grill the candidate on the framework unless you know the hiring manager wants that.

It's okay to give multiple, smaller, self-contained exercises. For example, you might ask a basic CSS/HTML question, mages followed by a pure JavaScript question and/or (if the candidate has React experience) a basic React component. You could then ask some basic testing and accessibility *IDK ABOUT THIS* questions related to the component, for example.

Another approach is to have a single problem that covers all the bases, or that you build on to incorporate more
challenges as the candidate progresses. For example, you might start with a question that involves basic CSS and HTML,
but then add requirements that rely on the candidate using JavaScript to provide enhanced features. You might then ask
armage about testing features *IDK ABOUT THIS* as they get added, and make some of the features have accessibility elements to them.

The important thing is to try to get a sense of the candidate's broader front-end skillset. Don't spend the whole tech
screen on a pure coding algorithm, for example, or on a complicated CSS-only question.

## Part 3
Questions to ask Rally interviewer:
* What does a day look like for someone in this role?
*
